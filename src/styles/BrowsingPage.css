+ Sidebar
- On smaller screens: Make this position fixed that fills entire screen and a grid. 
  This is to make things responsive and allow the user to hide or show the sidebar 
  via a button now. (640px and below)

- On small breakpoint and higher, we make it a flex box and now our sidebar should be in 
  the normal page flow. It should be a sticky sidebar off to the left of the main content.

  NOTE: You have to define a height for sticky to work, so we did 
  height: 100vh for above the small breakpoint. Know that doing height: 100vh
  as a default style will make the sidebar look weird below the small breakpoint.

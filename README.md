# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- BOOK MARK: 
1. Next we should set up some tests to practice what we've learned for testing in javascript and react. 
  Also to make sure everything works of cse
2. Set up our search button to work.
3. Set up the template for the game page and dynamic segments using slugs we 
4. Set up shopping cart page and somehow link it to the browsing page. Here we
  are required to have a badge that indicates the amount of stuff in cart.
5. Set up user page and protected routes. Also should set up smart redirects as well.
6. Set up dark theme and theme toggling. Theme changing should not affect the login or registration 
pages, they should only affect pages that have bene umbrellad under AppLayout.
7. A 'gif' loader instead of 'loading...' would be nice using svg and css animations as 
Alex's example used "<svg crossorigin="anonymous" viewBox="25 25 50 50" class="go6123017 "><circle class="go1299843785" cx="50" cy="50" r="20"></circle></svg>"
which would be just svg and css animations.
DEV NOTE: Numbers 5 or 6 must use useContext, probably going to be 5.

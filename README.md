# React + Vite

/*
- BOOK MARK: 


- Give the error message for game details a link back to the browsing page
- Create a catch all route 

1. Set up back button, the user clicks on a card, and wants to go back to the 
  browsing page, they should return to where they left off.





2. Set up our search button to work.
4. Set up shopping cart page and somehow link it to the browsing page. Here we
  are required to have a badge that indicates the amount of stuff in cart.
5. Set up user page and protected routes. Also should set up smart redirects as well.
6. Set up dark theme and theme toggling. Theme changing should not affect the login or registration 
pages, they should only affect pages that have bene umbrellad under AppLayout.
7. A 'gif' loader instead of 'loading...' would be nice using svg and css animations as 
Alex's example used "<svg crossorigin="anonymous" viewBox="25 25 50 50" class="go6123017 "><circle class="go1299843785" cx="50" cy="50" r="20"></circle></svg>"
which would be just svg and css animations.
DEV NOTE: Numbers 5 or 6 must use useContext, probably going to be 5.

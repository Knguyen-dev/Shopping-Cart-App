# React + Vite

/*
- BOOK MARK: 
5. Set up user page page, just have simple username thing and theme toggling button.

7. Before setting up dark theme, I think we should clean up our css. Try to keep most of our tailwind
  classes in the markup of components. Then and dark theme, and protected routes. Also should set up smart redirects as well.

8. Set up dark theme and theme toggling. Theme changing should not affect the login or registration 
pages, they should only affect pages that have bene umbrellad under AppLayout.

9. A 'gif' loader instead of 'loading...' would be nice using svg and css animations as 
Alex's example used "<svg crossorigin="anonymous" viewBox="25 25 50 50" class="go6123017 "><circle class="go1299843785" cx="50" cy="50" r="20"></circle></svg>"
which would be just svg and css animations.
DEV NOTE: Numbers 5 or 6 must use useContext, probably going to be 5.
